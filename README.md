James Shore Live
================

This example code is used in my [Twitch.tv livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/jamesshorelive). See the individual episodes for more information.


Prerequisites
-------------

To run this code, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).


Running the Tests
-----------------

Run `./build.sh` to run the tests once, or `./watch.sh` to run the tests every time a file changes.

Use `./build.sh quick` or `./watch.sh quick` to perform an incremental build, and `./clean.sh` to reset the incremental build.

On Windows, use `build` or `build quick` to perform a build. Sorry, the watch script doesn't work on Windows.

James Shore Live
================

This example code is used in my [Twitch.tv livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/jamesshorelive). See the individual episodes for more information.


Running the Code
----------------

To run the code in this repository, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Then:

* Run `./build.sh` to run the tests once, or `./watch.sh` to run the tests every time a file changes.

* Use `./build.sh quick` or `./watch.sh quick` to perform an incremental build, and `./clean.sh` to reset the incremental build.

* On Windows, use `build` or `build quick` and `watch` or `watch quick` instead. If you are using gitbash, the `*.sh` versions will also work, and they display the output better.

All commands must be run from the repository root.

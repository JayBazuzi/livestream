# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:

# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):
# output_style = :expanded or :nested or :compact or :compressed

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
# relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
# line_comments = false


# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass



# Syntax preference
preferred_syntax      = :scss

# Determine whether Compass generates relative or absolute paths
relative_assets       = false

# Determines whether line comments should be added to compiled css for easier debugging
line_comments         = false

# CSS output style - :nested, :expanded, :compact, or :compressed
output_style          = :expanded
